# Flex

Flex is the ultimate ruby client for [elasticsearch][http://elasticsearch.org/]. It is powerful, fast and efficient, easy to use and customize.

It covers ALL the elasticsearch API, and transparently integrates it with your app and its components, like `Rails`, `ActiveRecord`, `Mongoid`, `ActiveModel`, `will_paginate`, `kaminari`, `elasticsearch-mapper-attachments`, ...

It also implements and integrates very advanced features like chainable scopes, live-reindex, cross-model syncing, query fragment reuse, parent/child relationships, templating, self-documenting tools, detailed debugging, ...
